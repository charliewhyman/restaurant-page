# restaurant-page
A dynamically-rendered page for a fictional restaurant.

# Introduction

Using JavaScript to generate the entire contents of a website for a fictional restaurant, including the following pages:

- Home, including an introduction of the restaurant
- Menu, including a list of menu items, descriptions and prices
- Contact, including phone and email links

# Approach

This project uses webpack to bundle the CSS, HTML and JS files for each page.

The pages are generated by three functions, stored in separate .js files:
- generateHomeTab (called on initial load)
- generateMenuTab
- generateContactTab

The menu items are stored in an array of objects with the following keys:

- Category
- Item
- Price
- Description

The menu is populated by the array objects, with each object being placed into a different flexbox based on its category.
